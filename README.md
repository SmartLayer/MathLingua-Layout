# math-friendly-xkb

This repo contains a modified variation of the US International
keyboard with AltGr dead keys layout. It's modified from the
`/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us` file shipped with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

The major changes are:

- Replacing 'currency' symbol with Thai_baht symbol which is used for
  Bitcoin.

- Adding a <super> key level for every letter in English alphabet
  which produces an Italic variant in Unicode, often used in
  mathematical expressions.

- Adding <super> key level for every digit which produces a subscript digit.



- Adding <shift> + <super> level for every digit which produces a
  superscript digit.

- Adding <shift> + <super> level for every letter in English alphabet
  which produces a superscript letter if there exists one.


- Adding division slash and fraction slash.


- Adding the first 4 of the traditional order oef note symbols in
  English:
